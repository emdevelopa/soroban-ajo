## 20+ Slide Presentation for Partnerships and Investors

## Slide 1: Title Slide

**Visual:** Clean, professional design with logo

**Content:**
```
SOROBAN AJO
Blockchain-Powered Community Savings

[Logo]

[Founder Name], CEO
[Email] | [Website]
[Date]
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Thank you for your time today. I'm [Name], founder of Soroban Ajo. We're bringing traditional African community savings to the blockchain, making it transparent, trustless, and globally accessible."

---

## Slide 2: The Hook

**Visual:** Compelling statistic or image

**Content:**
```
1.7 BILLION
adults worldwide are unbanked

Yet many participate in informal savings groups

What if we could make these groups
transparent, secure, and global?
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Despite being unbanked, billions of people participate in informal savings groups. These groups work, but they lack transparency and security. That's the problem we're solving."

---

## Slide 3: The Problem

**Visual:** Icons or illustrations showing pain points

**Content:**
```
TRADITIONAL COMMUNITY SAVINGS FACES CHALLENGES:

❌ Requires trusted coordinator
   (Risk of fraud or mismanagement)

❌ Limited transparency
   (Manual record-keeping, disputes)

❌ Geographic constraints
   (Local participation only)

❌ No verifiable history
   (Can't build credit or reputation)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Traditional Ajo has served communities for centuries, but it has limitations. You need to trust a coordinator with everyone's money. Records are manual and prone to errors. And you can only participate locally."

---

## Slide 4: The Solution

**Visual:** Product screenshot or diagram

**Content:**
```
SOROBAN AJO: BLOCKCHAIN-POWERED COMMUNITY SAVINGS

✅ Trustless
   Smart contracts enforce rules automatically

✅ Transparent
   All transactions on-chain and verifiable

✅ Global
   Anyone with a wallet can participate

✅ Secure
   Audited smart contracts on Stellar
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Soroban Ajo solves these problems with blockchain technology. Smart contracts eliminate the need for a coordinator. Everything is transparent and verifiable. And anyone, anywhere can participate."

---

## Slide 5: How It Works

**Visual:** 4-step process diagram with icons

**Content:**
```
1. CREATE
   Set contribution amount, cycle duration, max members

2. JOIN
   Members join and commit to regular contributions

3. CONTRIBUTE
   Everyone contributes the same amount each cycle

4. RECEIVE
   Members take turns receiving the pooled funds
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"It's simple. Create a group with your parameters. Members join and commit. Everyone contributes each cycle. And members take turns receiving the full pool. Just like traditional Ajo, but automated and transparent."

---

## Slide 6: Product Demo

**Visual:** Animated walkthrough or key screenshots

**Content:**
```

[Screenshot 3: Contribution Flow]
[Screenshot 4: Payout Confirmation]
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me show you how it works. [Walk through key screens and user flows]. The interface is simple and intuitive, designed for users who may not be tech-savvy."

## Slide 7: Market Opportunity

**Visual:** Market size chart or infographic

**Content:**
```
MASSIVE ADDRESSABLE MARKET

Global Unbanked: 1.7B adults
• Africa: 350M
• Asia: 1.1B
• Latin America: 200M

Informal Savings Market: $500B+ annually

Target Market (5 years):
• 1M users
• $1B in savings facilitated
• 50+ countries
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"The market opportunity is enormous. 1.7 billion unbanked adults, with hundreds of billions flowing through informal savings groups. We're targeting 1 million users and $1 billion in savings within 5 years."

---

## Slide 8: Target Customers

**Visual:** User personas with photos

**Content:**
```
PRIMARY SEGMENTS:

👥 African Diaspora
   Stay connected to cultural practices while abroad

💼 Small Business Owners
   Access working capital without collateral

🏘️ Unbanked Populations
   Participate without bank accounts

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Community Organizations
   Strengthen bonds through collective savings
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"We're focused on four primary segments. The African diaspora wants to maintain cultural connections. Small business owners need capital. Unbanked populations need access. And community organizations want to build stronger bonds."

## Slide 9: Competitive Landscape

**Visual:** Competitive matrix or positioning map

**Content:**
```
                    High Tech
                        |
        Soroban Ajo ●  |
                        |
Low Trust -------------|------------- High Trust
                        |
    Traditional Ajo ●  |  ● DeFi Lending
                        |
                    Low Tech
```

**Competitors:**
- Traditional Ajo: High trust, low tech
- DeFi Lending: High tech, low trust (requires collateral)
- Microfinance: Medium trust, medium tech (high fees)
- Savings Apps: High tech, centralized (not community-based)

**Speaker Notes:**
"We occupy a unique position. Traditional Ajo has high trust but low tech. DeFi lending has high tech but requires collateral. We combine the community trust of Ajo with the transparency of blockchain."

---

## Slide 10: Competitive Advantages

**Visual:** Icons or badges for each advantage

**Content:**
```
WHY WE WIN:

🏆 Cultural Authenticity
   Built on centuries-old practices

🔒 Security First
   Professionally audited smart contracts

```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our competitive advantages are clear. We're culturally authentic, not just copying Western models. We're secure with audited contracts. We're global with Stellar's infrastructure. And we're focused on community, not just transactions."

---

## Slide 11: Traction

**Visual:** Growth charts and key metrics

**Content:**
```
STRONG EARLY TRACTION

Testnet Phase (3 months):
• 500+ groups created
• 2,000+ users
• $250K in test contributions
• 95% satisfaction rate

Mainnet (Projected Year 1):
• 1,000+ groups
• 10,000+ users
• $5M+ in contributions
• 10+ countries
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"We've already validated product-market fit. During our testnet phase, we saw strong engagement and 95% satisfaction. Our mainnet projections are conservative based on this traction."

---

## Slide 12: Business Model

**Visual:** Revenue streams diagram

**Content:**
```
SUSTAINABLE REVENUE MODEL

Phase 1 (Current): Free
• Build user base and network effects
• No platform fees

Phase 2 (Year 2): Freemium
• Basic groups: Free
• Premium features: $2-5/month
  - Larger groups
  - Flexible schedules
  - Priority support

---

## Slide 13: Unit Economics

**Visual:** Financial breakdown chart

**Content:**
```
ATTRACTIVE UNIT ECONOMICS

Average User:
• Lifetime: 24 months
• Groups joined: 2.5
• Contributions: $1,200
• Platform fee (0.5%): $6

Cost per User:
• Acquisition: $5
• Support: $2
• Infrastructure: $1
• Total: $8

Profit per User: $6 - $8 = -$2 (Year 1)
                 $12 - $8 = $4 (Year 2+)

LTV:CAC Ratio: 2.4:1 (healthy)
```

**Speaker Notes:**
"Our unit economics are attractive. We lose money in year one as we acquire users, but become profitable in year two. Our LTV to CAC ratio of 2.4 is healthy for a fintech startup."
