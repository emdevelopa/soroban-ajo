# Soroban Ajo: Blockchain-Powered Community Savings

## Bringing Traditional African Savings to the Digital Age

---

## What is Ajo?

Ajo (also known as Esusu) is a time-tested community savings system practiced across Africa for generations. Members form groups, contribute fixed amounts regularly, and take turns receiving the pooled funds. It's simple, effective, and builds financial discipline.

**The Challenge:** Traditional Ajo requires a trusted coordinator who manages funds and records. This creates risks of fraud, mismanagement, and limited accessibility.

**Our Solution:** Soroban Ajo brings this proven system to the Stellar blockchain, making it trustless, transparent, and globally accessible.

## How It Works

### 1. Create a Group
Set your contribution amount, cycle duration, and maximum members. You become the first member automatically.

### 2. Invite Members
Friends, family, or community members join your group. Everyone commits to the same contribution amount.

### 3. Contribute Each Cycle
Members contribute their fixed amount each cycle (weekly, monthly, etc.). All transactions are recorded on-chain.

### 4. Receive Payouts
When all members contribute, the total pool goes to the next recipient in rotation. Everyone receives exactly once.

### 5. Complete the Cycle
After all members receive their payout, the group completes successfully. Start a new group anytime!
