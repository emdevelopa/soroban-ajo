### What is Ajo?

**Headline:**
A Time-Tested Savings System

**Content:**
Ajo (also known as Esusu, Susu, or ROSCA) is a traditional community savings system practiced across Africa, Asia, and Latin America for centuries.

**How Traditional Ajo Works:**
1. A group of people agree to contribute a fixed amount regularly
2. Each cycle, one member receives the total pool
3. The recipient rotates until everyone has received once
4. The process builds financial discipline and community bonds

**The Challenge:**
Traditional Ajo requires a trusted coordinator to collect funds and distribute payouts. This creates risks of fraud, mismanagement, and limited accessibility.

---

### How Blockchain Solves This

**Headline:**
Smart Contracts Replace Coordinators

**Content:**
Soroban Ajo uses smart contracts on the Stellar blockchain to automate the entire process. No coordinator needed. No trust required.

**Benefits:**
- **Trustless:** Rules enforced by code, not people
- **Transparent:** All transactions visible on-chain
- **Automated:** Payouts execute automatically
- **Global:** Anyone with a wallet can participate
- **Secure:** Audited smart contracts protect funds
