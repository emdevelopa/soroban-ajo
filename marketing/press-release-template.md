Soroban Ajo Launches Blockchain-Powered Community Savings Platform on Stellar

Traditional African savings system meets modern blockchain technology to serve 
1.7 billion unbanked adults worldwide

[CITY, STATE] – [DATE] – Soroban Ajo, a decentralized rotational savings and 
credit association (ROSCA) platform, today announced the official launch of its 
blockchain-powered community savings solution on the Stellar network. The platform 
brings the centuries-old African tradition of Ajo (also known as Esusu) to the 
blockchain, making it transparent, trustless, and globally accessible.

Ajo is a traditional community savings system where members form groups, contribute 
fixed amounts regularly, and take turns receiving the pooled funds. While this 
system has served African communities for generations, it has historically required 
a trusted coordinator and been limited to local participants. Soroban Ajo eliminates 
these barriers through smart contract automation.

"Over 1.7 billion adults globally are unbanked, yet many participate in informal 
savings groups like Ajo," said [Founder Name], Founder and CEO of Soroban Ajo. 
"We're not reinventing the wheel—we're making a proven system more secure, 
transparent, and accessible to anyone with a smartphone and internet connection."

KEY FEATURES:

• Trustless Operation: Smart contracts enforce rules automatically, eliminating 
  the need for a central coordinator
• Full Transparency: All contributions and payouts are recorded on the Stellar 
  blockchain and publicly verifiable
• Global Accessibility: Anyone with a Stellar wallet can create or join savings 
  groups from anywhere in the world
• Low Cost: Minimal transaction fees on Stellar (fractions of a cent per transaction)
• Multi-Token Support: Save in XLM, USDC, EURC, or other Stellar assets
• Mobile-Friendly: Accessible from any device with a web browser

The platform has already seen significant traction during its testnet phase, with 
over 500 groups created, 2,000 users participating, and $250,000 in test 
contributions processed. User satisfaction ratings exceeded 95%.

"Soroban Ajo helped me save $3,000 in six months," said Amara O., an early user 
from Lagos, Nigeria. "The transparency is incredible—I can see every transaction 
on the blockchain. It's like traditional Ajo, but better."

The launch comes at a critical time for financial inclusion. According to the 
World Bank, 1.7 billion adults remain unbanked, with the highest concentrations 
in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Traditional banking infrastructure often fails 
to serve these populations due to high costs, documentation requirements, and 
geographic barriers.

Soroban Ajo is built on Stellar, a blockchain network designed for financial 
inclusion with fast transaction speeds (3-5 seconds), low fees ($0.00001 per 
transaction), and built-in support for multiple currencies. The platform's smart 
contracts have been professionally audited for security.

ROADMAP:

The company plans to introduce additional features in the coming months, including:
• Native mobile applications for iOS and Android (Q1 2027)
• Fiat on/off-ramps for local currencies (Q1 2027)
• Flexible payout schedules and configurations (Q4 2026)
• Reputation system for reliable members (Q2 2027)
• Insurance pool for group protection (Q2 2027)

Soroban Ajo is open-source and community-funded, with support from the Stellar 
Community Fund and Drips Wave public goods funding program.
