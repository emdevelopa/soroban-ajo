/// Get the current pause state from instance storage.
///
/// Returns `false` if the pause state has not been set, meaning the contract
/// starts in an unpaused state by default. This function is used internally
/// by the pausable module and can also be called directly to check the current
/// pause status.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - The contract environment used to access instance storage
///
/// # Returns
/// `true` if the contract is paused, `false` otherwise
///
/// # Storage Strategy
/// The pause state is stored in instance storage under the key "PAUSED".
/// Instance storage is appropriate for contract-level configuration because:
/// - It provides fast O(1) access
/// - It persists across contract calls and upgrades
/// - It matches the pattern used for admin storage
/// - It has lower cost than persistent storage for frequently accessed data

///
/// This is a private helper function used by `pause()` and `unpause()` to
/// update the pause state. It should not be called directly from outside
/// this module.

/// * `env` - The contract environment used to access instance storage
/// * `paused` - The new pause state (`true` to pause, `false` to unpause)

///
/// This is the primary guard function that should be called at the beginning
/// of all state-mutating operations. It provides a fail-fast mechanism to
/// prevent any state changes when the contract is in a paused state.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `env` - The contract environment used to check the pause state
///
/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` if the contract is not paused (operation can proceed)
/// * `Err(AjoError::ContractPaused)` if the contract is paused
///
/// # Usage
/// Add this check at the start of state-mutating functions:
/// ```ignore
/// pausable::ensure_not_paused(&env)?;
/// ```

/// contract is paused, all state-mutating operations (create_group, join_group,
/// contribute, execute_payout) will fail with a `ContractPaused` error. Query
/// operations and admin functions remain available during the pause.
///
/// The pause mechanism is designed for emergency situations such as:
/// - Detected security vulnerabilities
/// - Ongoing attacks or exploits
/// - Maintenance periods requiring state freeze
/// - Investigation of suspicious activity

/// * `env` - The contract environment used to verify admin and set pause state

/// # Returns
/// * `Ok(())` if the pause was successful
/// * `Err(AjoError::UnauthorizedPause)` if the caller is not the admin
///
/// # Authorization
/// This function requires admin authentication via `require_auth()`. The admin
/// address is retrieved from instance storage using `storage::get_admin()`.
///
/// # Idempotency
/// Calling pause when already paused is safe and will succeed without error.

/// This function can only be called by the contract administrator. When the

/// Unpausing should be done after:
/// - The emergency situation has been resolved
/// - Security vulnerabilities have been patched
/// - Maintenance has been completed
/// - Investigation has concluded
///

/// * `env` - The contract environment used to verify admin and clear pause state
