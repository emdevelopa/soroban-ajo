## Becoming a Maintainer

### Path to Maintainership

We're always looking for dedicated contributors to join the core team!

**Typical path:**
1. Start as a contributor
2. Make regular, quality contributions
3. Help review others' PRs
4. Engage with the community
5. Express interest in maintainer role
6. Current maintainers vote on invitation

**What we look for:**
- Consistent contributions over 3+ months
- Deep understanding of the codebase
- Good communication skills
- Collaborative attitude
- Commitment to project values
- Available time for maintenance duties

### Maintainer Onboarding

New maintainers receive:
1. Repository write access
2. Access to maintainer channels
3. Mentorship from existing maintainers
4. Introduction to workflows and tools
5. Gradual responsibility increase

## Maintainer Duties

### Weekly
- Review new issues and PRs
- Respond to community questions
- Update project board
- Participate in maintainer sync (if scheduled)

### Monthly
- Review project health metrics
- Update roadmap
- Community engagement (blog post, AMA, etc.)
- Dependency updates

### Quarterly
- Roadmap review and planning
- Community survey
- Security review
- Performance assessment

## Stepping Down

Maintainers can step down at any time by:
1. Notifying other maintainers
2. Completing handoff of ongoing work
3. Updating documentation
4. Moving to emeritus status (if desired)

We deeply appreciate all contributions, regardless of duration!

## Conflict Resolution

### Process

1. **Direct discussion**: Maintainers try to resolve disagreement directly
2. **Mediation**: If needed, another maintainer mediates
3. **Lead decision**: For deadlocks, lead maintainer makes final call
4. **Community input**: For major disagreements, seek community feedback

### Escalation

For serious issues (Code of Conduct violations, etc.):
1. Report to conduct@soroban-ajo.example.com
2. Issue handled by maintainers not involved
3. Follow enforcement guidelines in Code of Conduct

## Governance

### Current Model: Benevolent Dictator (Temporary)

While the project is young, the lead maintainer has final say on major decisions, with input from other maintainers and community.

### Future Model: Community Governance (Planned)

**Timeline**: Transition to DAO governance by Q1 2027

**Planned structure:**
- Community proposals
- Token-weighted voting
- Elected maintainer council
- Transparent decision-making
